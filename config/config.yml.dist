## Debugging
#
# Global debugging on/off switch
#
# If enabled, ALL forms will go into debug mode.
# NOTE: setting the debug on a specific form will override these global settings
# — specific for and to that form. It is considered best practice to use only
# this global setting.
debug:
    enabled: true
    address: noreply@example.com

## CSRF protection
#
# Enable CSRF protection for forms. You should leave this set to 'true', unless
# you know what you're doing.
csrf: true

# Global templates used for rendering forms and emails.
#
# You can find assorted templates to copy and modify in the templates/
# directory. Simply copy them to a directory of your choosing in your theme
# and set the template you want to override.
#
# More information on available template overrides can be found in the
# Templates section of docs.
#
# NOTE: All paths are relative of your running theme.
#
# e.g. You created your templates in the `extensions/boltforms/` directory
# inside your theme, you would use similar to:
#
#templates:
#    form: extensions/boltforms/form.twig
#    email: extensions/boltforms/email.twig
#    subject: extensions/boltforms/subject.twig
#    files: extensions/boltforms/file_browser.twig

## reCAPTCHa set up
#
# NOTE: You can get your keys from https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin
# * `public_key` key will be labeled "Site key"
# * `private_key` key will be labeled "Secret key"
#
#recaptcha:
#    enabled: false
#    label: "Please enter the reCaptcha text to prove you're a human"
#    public_key: ''
#    private_key: ''
#    error_message: "The CAPTCHA wasn't entered correctly. Please try again."
#    theme: clean

## File Uploads
#
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SECURITY WARNING ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Handling file uploads is a very common attack vector used to compromise (hack)
# a server.
#
# BoltForms does a few things to help increase slightly the security of handling
# file uploads.
#
# Firstly, the directory that you specify for "base_directory" below should NOT
# be an route accessible to the outside world. We provide a special route should
# you wish to make the files browsable after upload.
#
# Secondly, is the "filename_handling" parameter. If an attacker knows the
# uploaded file name, this can make their job a bit easier. So we provide three
# options, e.g. uploading the file kitten.jpg:
#
# -------------------------------------
# | Setting | Resulting file name     |
# |-----------------------------------|
# | prefix  | kitten.Ze1d352rrI3p.jpg |
# | suffix  | kitten.jpg.Ze1d352rrI3p |
# | keep    | kitten.jpg              |
# -------------------------------------
#
# We recommend "suffix" as this is the most secure, alternatively "prefix" will
# aid in file browsing. However "keep" should always be used with caution!
#
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SECURITY WARNING ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
#uploads:
#    enabled: false                                 # The global on/off switch for upload handling
#    base_directory: /full/path/for/uploaded/files/ # Outside web root and writable by the web server's user
#    filename_handling: suffix                      # Can be either "prefix", "suffix", or "keep"
#    management_controller: false                   # Enable a controller to handle browsing and downloading of uploaded files
